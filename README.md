#Wordsy - Track Trending Etsy Listings Most Frequent Tags

This program is used to check trending listings and their tags on Etsy.  It calculates the highest tag keyword frequencies and displays them from most frequent. This program can be used to give Etsy shop owners an idea of the most frequent trending SEO metrics on Etsy.

#Motivation

I wanted to build a script that could easily run and show you the most freqent tags for Etsy's Trending Listings. This way shop owners could have an idea of when they need to start SEO for a new season or for trends the market demands. Direct market metrics to give definite timelines for SEO changes could help a shop owner stay on top of their SEO game. 

#How To Run

Download and navigate into the scripts directory and then run python wordsy.py

#Ideas For Future Development

Pull data not just from the Max listings allowed by Etsy ,but use their "offset" to cycle through the max of 500 listings to give a better idea of less poplular "Niche Trends" that could still tranlate into sells for shop owner.
